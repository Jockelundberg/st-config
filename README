# To only install st with this config, use

> git clone git@github.com:Jockelundberg/st-config.git
> cd st-config
> makepkg
> sudo pacman -U st-0.8.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz

and that's it.


# Reminder to myself of how to use/generate the patch file and install the package
Get this repository
> git clone git@github.com:Jockelundberg/st-config.git
> cd st-config

Get the st source repository and extract it by doing

> curl -O dl.suckless.org/st/st-0.8.1.tar.gz
> tar -xzf st-0.8.1.tar.gz

Move into it
> cd st-0.8.1

Initialize a git archive and commit the original source
> git init
> git add .
> git commit -m "Initial commit"

Now make any changes you'd like, for instance apply the patch my_changes.diff
(assuming it is in the directory above)
> patch < ../my_changes.diff

Make any further changes.
> ...(?)

Now create the new patch file
> git diff --no-prefix > ../my_changes.diff

Now I commit this change to this reposity and push it here:
> cd ..
> git commit -a -m "My new patch, doing this awesome stuff."

You can also remove the st-0.8.1 folder, if you're done with making the new
patch file. But it is not necessary to build the package, and should not
interfere if it is not removed.
> rm -rf st-0.8.1

Build and install the package using arch's pacman:
> makepkg
> sudo pacman -U st-0.8.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz

? Profit!
